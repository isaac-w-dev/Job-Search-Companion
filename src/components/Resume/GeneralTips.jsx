        Most important tip: Always tailor your resume to each employer you apply to.
        <br />
        A few targeted applications have a much better chance of catching an employers attention, as opposed to a very general application and mass applying to jobs
        <br/>
        Employers can tell when you just want a job, and don't care who with. By adding a few indications in your resume that it is personal to that company, you increase your chances significantly
        <br/>
        Here's a few ways you can indicate to the company that you tailored it specifically to them:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Name your document after the company, position, your name, and the kind of document</li>
        <li>Ex. Cover_Letter_Company_Position_YourName</li>
        <li>Include the name of the company in your summary</li>
        <li>Use as many key words from the job posting as possible</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Hiring managers only spend about 7 seconds looking at any given resume. With this in mind it is important to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Focus your resume solely on demonstrating traits and skills that directly transfer to the job you are applying</li>
        <li>Keep your resume to a single page for entry-level positions</li>
        <li>Order your resume from most important to least important for the employer to know</li>
        <li>Format your resume so that it is easy to skim this means using spacing, bold fonts, and headings appropriately</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
