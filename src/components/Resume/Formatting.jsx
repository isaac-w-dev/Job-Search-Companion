      <h2>Applicant Tracking Systems</h2>
      <h3>Applicant Tracking Systems are used by employers to search and filter out resumes. They can be quite finicky so it is important to stick to some basic rules to make sure your resume doesn't get filtered out:</h3>
      <h4>Don't use photos, graphics, tables, text boxes, extra columns, or emojis</h4>
      <h4>Avoid using templates</h4>
      <h2>Fonts:</h2>
      <h3>Only use 2 fonts maximum in your resume with all headers the same size and font, and all content the same size and font</h3>
      <h3>Stick to fonts like: Helvetica, Arial, Calibri, Georgia, Tahoma, Verdana, Open Sans, Century Gothic, Courier (Only for headings)</h3>
      <h3>Don't use italics, if you want to emphasize something, stick to bold</h3>
      <h3>Headings should be 11-16 pt</h3>
      <h3>Body should be 9-12 pt</h3>
      <h3>DO NOT use Wingdings, Times New Roman, Comic Sans</h3>
